# GitHub namer

This is an exercise for the second sprint in [Adalab](https://adalab.es/). The main goal of this exercise was to practice JavaScript and AJAX requests.

It's a simple webapp where you can write a GitHub username, and the page will return the user's real first name! It's been developed using native JavaScript, with no frameworks, and using the [GitHub API](https://developer.github.com/v3/).

I'm still learning so please, if you spot a bug, want to improve my code or just show me another way to do things, don't hesitate to open an issue or send a PR!
